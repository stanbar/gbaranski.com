      <description>Introduction This post is my process of creating TUI application in Rust for Houseflow, it will be used to trigger some events on embedded devices, like turning on lights and etc.
Goal I&amp;rsquo;d like to make something similar to ncspot, Spotify Client in CLI, which is using cursive.
Getting started The first step is to initialize an empty project
cargo new --bin rust-blog-tui This will create a directory with the given name and few files inside.</description>

      <description>My projects All of them are available on my Github profile
Houseflow Home automation platform, the project in which I put the most effort. Started it at the very beginning of the programming journey. This project involves a lot of different topics, like networking, electronics, mobile and web development, databases, devops, etc.
Made using
 Rust for high performance networking services with low memory footprint. My plan is to run that on cheap Raspberry Pi.</description>
